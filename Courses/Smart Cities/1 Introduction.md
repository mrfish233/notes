- visualizing data
- classification
- prediction
- recommendation
- support of decision making

## Data Communication

Purpose: bring information from one location to another
Motivation:

- Sensing: collect information
- Actuating: operate machines by sending commands to other machines and/or users
- Logging: exchange information between machines
- Notification: notify people for the new information that has happened or is going to happen

### Model

A model is a description of

- some specific properties of the subject we have interest in
- how those properties drive the behavior of the subject

1. Modeling the semantics of data communication applications
	- unicast (one-to-one)
	- broadcast (one-to-all); all-to-one
	- multicast (one-to-some); some-to-one
2. Modeling the service for data communication pairs
	- direct communication
	- broker-based communication

### Requirements

- Functionalities
- Performance
	- scalability: expect to be worked
	- sustainability
	- cybersecurity: is resistant to cyber attack
	- quality-of-service (QOS)
	- timeliness: real-time data collection/notification
	- fault tolerance: graceful degradation
	- user privacy: data collecting
	- interoperability: how does everything work together

### Challenges

How to meet the requirements?
