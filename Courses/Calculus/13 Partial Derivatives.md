## 13.1 Functions of Several Variables

### Definition 1 - Function of Several Variables

Suppose $D$ is a set of $n$-tuples of real numbers $(x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n})$. A **real-valued function** $f$ on $D$ is a rule that assigns a real number

$$
w = f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n})
$$

to each element in $D$. The set $D$ is the function's **domain**. The set of $w$-values taken on by $f$ is the function's **range**.

$w$ is the **dependent variable** of $f$, and $f$ is the function of the $n$ **independent variables** $x_{1}$ to $x_{n}$.
