# Vectors and the Geometry of Space

## 11.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems

### Distance Between Points

The distance between two points $P_{1}(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$ and $P_{2}(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})$ is

$$
|P_{1}P_{2}| = \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2}-y_{1})^{2} + (z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}
$$

### Standard Equation for Sphere

The standard equation for the sphere of radius $a$ and center $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ is

$$
(x-x_{0})^{2} + (y-y_{0})^{2} + (z-z_{0})^{2} = a^{2}
$$

## 11.2 Vectors

### Definition 1 - Vector

The vector represented by the directed line segment $\overset\rightharpoonup{AB}$ has **initial point** $A$ and **terminal point** $B$, and its length is denoted by $|\overset\rightharpoonup{AB}|$. Two vectors are **equal** if they have the same length and direction.

The component form of $v$ if it is **two-dimensional** vector is

$$
\textbf{v} = \langle v_{1}, v_{2} \rangle.
$$

The component form of $v$ if it is **three-dimensional** vector is

$$
\textbf{v} = \langle v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3} \rangle.
$$

The **magnitude** or **length** of the vector $\textbf{v} = \langle v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3} \rangle = \langle x_{2}-x_{1}, y_{2}-y_{1}, z_{2}-z_{1} \rangle$ is the nonnegative number

$$
\begin{align}
|\textbf{u}| &= \sqrt{{v_{1}}^{2} + {v_{2}}^{2} + {v_{3}}^{2}} \\
&= \sqrt{{(x_{2}-x_{1})}^{2} + {(y_{2}-y_{1})}^{2} + {(z_{2}-z_{1})}^{2}}.
\end{align}
$$

### Definition 2 - Vector Algebra Operations

Let $\textbf{u} = \langle u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3} \rangle$ and $\textbf{v} = \langle v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3} \rangle$ be vectors with $k$ a scalar, then

1. **Addition**: $\textbf{u} + \textbf{v} = \langle u_{1} + v_{1}, u_{2} + v_{2}, u_{3} + v_{3} \rangle$
2. **Scalar multiplication**: $k \textbf{u} = \langle ku_{1}, ku_{2}, ku_{3} \rangle$

### Properties of Vector Operations

Let $\textbf{u}, \textbf{v}, \textbf{w}$ be vectors and $a, b$ be scalars. Then

1. $\textbf{u} + \textbf{v} = \textbf{v} + \textbf{u}$
2. $(\textbf{u} + \textbf{v}) + \textbf{w} = \textbf{u} + (\textbf{v} + \textbf{w})$
3. $\textbf{u} + \textbf{0} = \textbf{u}$
4. $\textbf{u} + (-\textbf{u}) = \textbf{0}$
5. $0\textbf{u} = \textbf{0}$
6. $1\textbf{u} = \textbf{u}$
7. $a(b\textbf{u}) = (ab)\textbf{u}$
8. $a(\textbf{u} + \textbf{v}) = a\textbf{u} + a\textbf{v}$
9. $(a + b)\textbf{u} = a\textbf{u} + b\textbf{u}$

### Unit Vectors

If $\textbf{v} \ne 0$, then

1. $\cfrac{\textbf{v}}{|\textbf{v}|}$ is a **unit vector** called the direction of $\textbf{v}$;
2. the equation $\textbf{v} = |\textbf{v}| \cfrac{\textbf{v}}{|\textbf{v}|}$ expresses $\textbf{v}$ as its length times its direction.

### Midpoint of Line Segment

The **midpoint** $M$ of the line segment joining points $P_{1}(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$ and $P_{2}(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})$ is the point

$$
\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}, \frac{z_{1}+z_{2}}{2}\right).
$$
