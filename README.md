A repo that keeps all my notes.

The notes are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This includes some app-specific formatting, which therefore provides a better reading experience when utilized.

Besides notes, some of my daily works will also appear here. For example, my homework and daily notes will be included in this repo.
