# 12 Vector-Valued Functions and Motion in Space

## 12.1 Curves in Space and Their Tangents

A particle moves through space during a time interval $I$ is defined as function of its coordinates:

$$
x = f(t), \quad y = g(t), \quad z = h(t), \quad t \in I.
$$

The points $(x, y, z)$ make up the **curve** in space is called the particle's **path**. Its vector form is

$$
\textbf{r}(t) = \overset\rightharpoonup{OP}
= f(t) \textbf{i} + g(t) \textbf{j} + h(t) \textbf{k}.
$$
