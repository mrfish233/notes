# Vectors and the Geometry of Space

## 11.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems

### Distance Between Points

The distance between two points $P_{1}(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$ and $P_{2}(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})$ is

$$
|P_{1}P_{2}| = \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2}-y_{1})^{2} + (z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}
$$

### Standard Equation for Sphere

The standard equation for the sphere of radius $a$ and center $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ is

$$
(x-x_{0})^{2} + (y-y_{0})^{2} + (z-z_{0})^{2} = a^{2}
$$
